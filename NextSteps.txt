Next steps for training:

1. More photos of humans to help algorithm differentiate between monkeys and humans (zuckles.jpg was 60% confidence a monkey)
2. Train with more photos of gray langurs (48% confidence for dog)
3. Wild boar, dogs and porcupines can be left alone
4. https://towardsdatascience.com/inferences-from-a-tf-lite-model-transfer-learning-on-a-pre-trained-model-e16e7c5f0ee6
5. Train with more rhesus monkeys to get confidence above 70%
